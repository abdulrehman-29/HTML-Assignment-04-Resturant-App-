    <h1>Chiken Nehari</h1>
    <p>Chicken Nihari is a flavorful and aromatic Pakistani stew made by slow-cooking tender chicken pieces in a rich, spicy gravy infused with ginger, garlic, and a blend of traditional spices. Like its beef counterpart, it’s simmered until the chicken is soft and the flavors are deeply developed. Often enjoyed as a special breakfast or dinner dish, Chicken Nihari is garnished with fresh ginger, green chilies, coriander, and a squeeze of lemon. Served with naan or paratha, it’s a comforting and satisfying meal loved for its bold and warming taste.</p>
