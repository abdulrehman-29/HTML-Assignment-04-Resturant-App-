    <h1>Beef Nehari</h1>
    <p>Beef Nihari is a classic Pakistani slow-cooked stew made with tender beef shanks simmered overnight in a rich, spicy gravy of aromatic spices, ginger, garlic, and ghee. The word "Nihari" comes from the Arabic word Nahar, meaning morning, as it’s traditionally eaten as a hearty breakfast dish. This flavorful stew is thick, deeply spiced, and often garnished with fresh ginger, green chilies, lemon, and fresh coriander. Served with naan or paratha, Beef Nihari is a beloved comfort food, especially enjoyed during special occasions and festivals.</p>
