    <h1>Chapli Kabab</h1>
    <p>Chapli Kabab is a famous and flavorful Pashtun dish from Pakistan, especially popular in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Made with minced beef or mutton mixed with onions, tomatoes, green chilies, herbs, and spices, the mixture is shaped into flat, round patties and fried until crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Known for its spicy and smoky taste, Chapli Kabab is often served with naan, chutney, and salad. Its rich aroma and bold flavor make it a favorite street food and a must-have at BBQs and family feasts.</p>
