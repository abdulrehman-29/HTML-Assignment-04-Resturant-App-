    <h1>Chiken Tikka</h1>
    <p>Chicken Tikka is a famous Pakistani dish known for its rich flavor and smoky aroma. It’s made by marinating chicken pieces in yogurt, red chili, garlic, ginger, and traditional spices, then grilling them over hot coals or in a tandoor. The result is tender, juicy chicken with a slightly charred exterior. Often served with naan, salad, and mint chutney, Chicken Tikka is a favorite at BBQs, weddings, and family gatherings across Pakistan.</p>
