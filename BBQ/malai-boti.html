    <h1>Malai Boti</h1>
    <p>Malai Boti is a popular Pakistani BBQ dish known for its creamy, melt-in-the-mouth texture. It’s made with boneless chicken pieces marinated in a rich blend of cream, yogurt, cheese, ginger-garlic paste, and mild spices. The marinated chicken is then grilled or cooked over charcoal, giving it a smoky flavor while keeping it soft and juicy. Served with naan, salad, and mint chutney, Malai Boti is a favorite at family gatherings and festive occasions for its rich taste and smooth, buttery flavor.</p>
