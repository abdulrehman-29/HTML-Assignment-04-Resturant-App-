    <h1>Chiken Haleem</h1>
    <p>Chicken Haleem is a rich and flavorful Pakistani dish made by slow-cooking shredded chicken with a mixture of lentils, wheat, and aromatic spices until it becomes thick and creamy. It’s garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander, green chilies, lemon juice, and a drizzle of ghee, adding layers of taste and aroma. Often served with naan or eaten on its own, Chicken Haleem is a comforting and nutritious meal, especially popular during Ramadan and family gatherings for its warm, hearty flavor.</p>
