    <h1>Beef Haleem</h1>
    <p>Beef Haleem is a traditional and hearty Pakistani dish made by slow-cooking shredded beef with a blend of lentils, wheat, and aromatic spices until it forms a thick, smooth paste-like consistency. Rich in flavor and nutrition, it’s seasoned with fried onions, ginger, lemon juice, and fresh coriander. Often enjoyed with naan or on its own, Haleem is especially popular during Ramadan and special occasions. Its unique taste and creamy texture make it a beloved comfort food across Pakistan.</p>
