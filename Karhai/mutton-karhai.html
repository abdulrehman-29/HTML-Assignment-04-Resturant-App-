    <h1>Mutton Karhai</h1>
    <p>Mutton Karahi is a flavorful and aromatic Pakistani dish made with tender pieces of mutton cooked in a karahi (a deep, circular cooking pot) with tomatoes, green chilies, garlic, ginger, and a blend of traditional spices. Slow-cooked to perfection, the mutton becomes soft and juicy, absorbing the rich and spicy gravy. Garnished with fresh coriander and julienned ginger, it’s usually served hot with naan or roti. Mutton Karahi is a popular choice for special occasions and gatherings, loved for its bold taste and hearty texture.</p>
