    <h1>Paratha</h1>
    <p>Paratha is a popular flaky and layered flatbread widely enjoyed in Pakistani cuisine. Made from whole wheat flour, it’s rolled out, layered with ghee or oil, folded multiple times, and then cooked on a hot griddle until golden and crispy. Parathas can be plain or stuffed with fillings like potatoes, spinach, or minced meat. Known for its rich, buttery taste and slightly crispy texture, paratha is often served with curries, yogurt, or pickles, making it a delicious and satisfying part of any meal.</p>
