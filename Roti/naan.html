    <h1>Naan</h1>
    <p>Naan is a soft, fluffy flatbread that is a staple in Pakistani and South Asian cuisine. It’s traditionally made from white flour, yeast, yogurt, and milk, then cooked in a hot clay oven called a tandoor, which gives it a slightly charred, smoky flavor. Naan can be plain or topped with ingredients like garlic, butter, or herbs. It’s commonly served alongside curries, kebabs, and other rich dishes, perfect for scooping up flavorful sauces and gravies. Its warm, pillowy texture makes naan a favorite bread at every meal.</p>
