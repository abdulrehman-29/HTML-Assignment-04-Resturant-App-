    <h1>Sindhi Biryani</h1>
    <p>Sindhi Biryani is a traditional and aromatic rice dish from the Sindh region of Pakistan, known for its bold spices and rich flavors. It’s made with layers of basmati rice, marinated meat (usually mutton or chicken), potatoes, and a mix of fragrant spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. What makes Sindhi Biryani special is its tangy taste, often enhanced with yogurt, tomatoes, and green chilies, giving it a perfect blend of spice and zest. Served with raita or salad, it’s a festive favorite that beautifully represents Sindhi culture and cuisine.</p>
