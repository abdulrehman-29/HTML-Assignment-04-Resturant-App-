    <h1>Fish Roll</h1>
    <p>Fish Roll is a popular Pakistani snack made with spiced, minced fish that’s cooked and then wrapped in a soft, flaky flatbread like paratha or tortilla. The fish is usually seasoned with herbs, spices, and sometimes a tangy chutney to add extra flavor. It’s often garnished with fresh vegetables like onions, lettuce, and tomatoes, making it a tasty and convenient street food option. Crispy, flavorful, and satisfying, Fish Roll is loved for its unique blend of spices and easy-to-eat style.</p>
