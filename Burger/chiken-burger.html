    <h1>Chiken Burger</h1>
    <p>A Chicken Burger is a delicious and popular fast food made with a tender, juicy chicken patty that’s either
        grilled or fried until golden brown. It’s served in a soft burger bun with fresh lettuce, tomato, cheese, and
        flavorful sauces like mayonnaise or garlic sauce. Some versions use spicy marinades or crispy coatings for extra
        taste and crunch. Light yet satisfying, the Chicken Burger is a favorite choice for people who love a perfect
        mix of flavor, texture, and convenience.</p>
