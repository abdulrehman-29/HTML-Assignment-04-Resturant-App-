    <h1>Beef Burger</h1>
    <p>A beef burger is a classic and widely loved fast food made with a juicy, seasoned ground beef patty grilled or pan-fried to perfection. It’s typically served in a soft bun with fresh lettuce, tomato, onions, cheese, and sauces like ketchup or mayonnaise. Some versions include extras like pickles, fried eggs, or special sauces for added flavor. Whether enjoyed at a roadside stall or a gourmet restaurant, a beef burger is a satisfying meal that combines savory, smoky, and fresh flavors in every bite.</p>
